## Project Idea: 
The aim of this project is to construct a method that takes an image from it as an input and extracts characters (alphabets, digits, symbols).
The image can be of handwritten or typed text as a method of data entry from written documents


## Technologies and Tools:
Python, The MADBase, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) 


## Launch
No external tools will be needed for the installation of the program except for the internal Python libraries used in the program
